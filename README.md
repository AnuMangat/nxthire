Test Scenarios-
You can follow these steps to test the implementation of rubric.
1.	Home button on the main page u can search postings by simply clicking search jobs or putting your criteria. Right now, there is not much different job titles to search, but among ones which are there you can see when u just click on search job. Example- software engineer, data analyst. Also, you can search simply giving locations or job title both together is also not mandatory.
